## Our Team
We are made from:
- Arctica Team what contributes to all the Arctica projects.
- MuffinLM Team what contributes to only **MuffinLM**

## About MuffinLM

MuffinLM (short for Muffin Language Model) is designed for simplicity and flexibility in generating text. It supports various versions tuned for different writing styles, such as casual or fancy poetic outputs. We encouraged you to use our 5.8M parameters model because it's our best.

For more details, visit the [MuffinLM GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Arctica/MuffinLM-Beta).

## Roadmap

1. Making MuffinLM to be able to have a conversation
2. ~~Making in into a Transformer~~
